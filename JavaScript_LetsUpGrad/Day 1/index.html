    <h5>Various methods in console function</h5>
     <script src="scripts/methods.js"></script> 
    <p><h4>var</h4>The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.
        Example: var a =10;        
        Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
        The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
        The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.</p>
    <p><h4>let</h4>
        The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.        
        Example: let a =10;        
        The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.</p>
        <p><h4>const</h4>Const
            const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.
        Example: const a =10;</p>
    <script src="scripts/varletconst.js"></script>
